package obj

// Garbage collector liveness bitmap generation.

// The command line flag -live causes this code to print debug information.
// The levels are:
//
//	-live (aka -live=1): print liveness lists as code warnings at safe points
//	-live=2: print an assembly listing with liveness annotations
//	-live=3: print information during each computation phase (much chattier)
//
// Each level includes the earlier output as well.
